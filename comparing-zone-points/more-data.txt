For s(x), calculate s(beta), the peak of D2. Then draw curve [s(x)*d/dx(s(x))]/s(beta)
Then calculate s(alpha), the peak of D4  Then draw curve d^2/dx^2 [s(x)*d/dx(s(x))]/s(alpha).
What then are the gamma and delta?

Here, we divided D2(x) by D2(beta) to normalize the peaks for further calculations of the other points,
and we divided D4(x) by D4(alpha) to normalize their peaks too for further calculations.
D4(alpha) is given after dividing by s(beta), s.t. s_modif(beta)=1.
Likewise, D4(delta) and D2(gamma) is calculated relative to dividing D4 by |s(alpha)|.

observations
- tanh and erf have the highest relative peaks s(delta), meaning stronger no-return
policy but stronger resistance up to that point. The others all demonstrate that
an increase in delta causes a decrease in s(delta) - but tanh and erf live above
that curve. Their deltas being high-valued also inhibits escaping weights better. 
- The others, not tanh and erf, show a gradual decline from their beta peaks. (Would
it be worthwhile adjusting the x values too?). tanh and erf die faster, relatively, 
(erf more so), meaning they have a sharper smaller Zone C where weights receive high
signal, whereas the others can pass more signal to weights farther from beta/Zone C.
(Zones. A:near 0 lineary; B:near alpha; C:near beta; D:before gamma; E:at gamma; F:
final peak near delta; G: point of no return and perpetual entrenchment)
- D2(gamma): % of max signal when drift is zero. D4(beta): noise forces strength at 
  signal mountaintop. D2(alpha): % of max signal when noise is at its own max.
- D2(gamma), or the amount of max possible signal that gets thru when noise is minimal,
is highest for arctan, lowest for erf, and similar for all (except x-x^2*).
(it follows: alpha is high in er    ....?
I guess this means that arctan is most likely to oscillate and has a error and noise 
tradeoff better? D2(alpha) concords with this, that at alpha=max noise point, the 
signal arctan is weaker than any nondegenerate ones, as does D4(beta), which reports 
that noise rate is relatively weak at this 100% signal strength spot.
=> with a fixed signal-to-noise ratio, you might expect arctan to put weights into
emergent competitive attractors between D4 and D2 forces, and if the SNR changes 
then arctan might change more than others would? arctan might also work better with
larger step sizes.
- erf and tanh both have more specialization as weight value increases - the predominant
dynamic at the special points supresses the other more. 
- p=2 might be more noise tolerant overall and comparatively especially with smaller 
weights. This might be due to its extensive signal response range, as indicated by its
small D2(beta) factor==multiplication factor of the integrand summing to 1 in the limit.
gudder is similar but less pronounced.
- disregarding xrootx*, which is zero until 0.2 and has unique dynamics, and somewhat
degenerate x-x^2* , arctan has the furthest-out beta. Maybe a slow ramp-up or alpha about 
half of beta contributes to it having a large raw strength in beta as well as extended,
with delta also far out. I guess it could be helpful maybe for v_i expected to have 
many large values and a need for large zones closer to equally sized.
- side observation: when exp* and p=1 are scaled to both's beta peaks align at (0.5,1),
p=1 unanimously decays faster than exp* does. By a lot!

questions: 
- what is 0.5774 with regard to x^2 or sqrt(x)?
- is 0.8707 coincidence?
- does it make sense to make the zone b-c cutoff the point where SNR is 1?
